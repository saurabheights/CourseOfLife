    \begin{cvsection}{Summary}
    \textit{Computer Vision specialist with 5+ years professional experience, including 2 years devoted to developing real-time vision modules for national defense and 2 years to building image and video processing service for a social media platform. I specialized in neural network interpretatibility and its applications to weakly supervised semantic segmentation as part of my master's degree. As a work student at Terraloupe, I designed a training data management tool for geospatial annotations and at Edge Case Research I designed new SPIs for measuring safety of an autonomous vehicle perception system.}
